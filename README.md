# Project Name:- Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Classification

## Problem Statement

Despite advances in medical technology, coronary heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. The early detection of CHD risk is crucial for preventing and mitigating its impact. The current cardiovascular study on the residents of Framingham, Massachusetts provides an opportunity to use data to identify patients at risk of CHD. However, with over 4,000 records and 15 attributes, it is difficult to manually identify patients who are at high risk. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a predictive model that accurately classifies patients based on their risk of CHD. This will help to improve the early detection and prevention of CHD, reducing its impact on patients and the healthcare system.
